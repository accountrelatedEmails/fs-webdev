        <h1>Hypertext Markup Language</h1>

        <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It's an essential part of web development and is used to define the elements and layout of a web page. Here's a general overview of how HTML works and some of its main components:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>HTML primarily deals with text content. You use HTML tags to define and structure this content. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets, like &lt;tagname&gt;. Tags are typically used in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag (&lt;/tagname&gt;) to define the beginning and end of an element.</li>
            
            <li>Document Structure: An HTML document is structured as a hierarchy. At the top level is the &lt;html&gt; element, which contains two main sections: the &lt;head&gt; and the &lt;body&gt;. The &lt;head&gt; section contains meta-information about the page, like the title and links to external resources, while the &lt;body&gt; section contains the visible content of the page.</li>
            
            <li>Headings: HTML provides six levels of headings, from &lt;h1&gt; (the highest level) to &lt;h6&gt; (the lowest level). Headings are used to define the structure and hierarchy of the content.</li>
            
            <li>Paragraphs: &lt;p&gt; tags are used to create paragraphs of text. They automatically add some spacing between paragraphs for readability.</li>
            
            <li>Links: To create hyperlinks, you use the &lt;a&gt; tag. The href attribute within the &lt;a&gt; tag specifies the URL to which the link points.</li>
            
            <li>Lists: HTML supports ordered lists (&lt;ol&gt;) and unordered lists (&lt;ul&gt;), which contain list items (&lt;li&gt;). Lists are a way to organize and present information in a structured manner.</li>
            
            <li>Images: You can embed images in a web page using the &lt;img&gt; tag. The src attribute specifies the source (URL) of the image.</li>
            
            <li>Forms: HTML provides form elements like &lt;form&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, &lt;textarea&gt;, and &lt;button&gt; for collecting user input. Forms are used for various purposes, such as user registration, search, and data submission.</li>
            
            <li>Tables: The &lt;table&gt; element is used to create tables. It consists of rows (&lt;tr&gt;) and columns (&lt;td&gt; for data cells, &lt;th&gt; for header cells). Tables are often used to display tabular data.</li>
            
            <li>Divs and Spans: &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; are generic container elements that are often used for layout and styling purposes. They don't have any specific meaning on their own but can be styled with CSS.</li>
            
            <li>Comments: You can add comments in your HTML code using &lt;!-- comment text --&gt;. Comments are not visible to users but are useful for adding notes and explanations to your code.</li>
            
            <li>Attributes: Most HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information or settings. For example, the class attribute is commonly used for styling with CSS, and the id attribute can be used to uniquely identify elements.</li>

        <p class="last-padding">HTML is just one part of web development. To make web pages interactive and dynamic, you typically use JavaScript for client-side scripting and a server-side language like PHP, Python, or Node.js to handle server-side logic and data processing. Additionally, CSS is used for styling and layout to make your web pages visually appealing. These technologies together form the core of full stack web development.</p>
