        <h1>Server-Side-Rendering</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>Rendering on the Server: SSR is a technique where web pages are rendered on the server and then sent to the client as fully-formed HTML.</li>
            <li>SEO-Friendly: SSR improves Search Engine Optimization (SEO) because search engines can easily crawl and index the content.</li>
            <li>Initial Page Load: SSR provides a fast initial page load because the server sends the fully-rendered HTML, reducing client-side rendering time.</li>
            <li>Improved Performance: It enhances perceived performance as users see content sooner, especially on slower devices or connections.</li>
            <li>JavaScript for Interactivity: After the initial load, client-side JavaScript can take over for dynamic interactions, providing a rich user experience.</li>
            <li>Popular Frameworks: SSR is supported by popular frameworks like Next.js (for React) and Nuxt.js (for Vue.js).</li>
            <li>Complex Applications: SSR is suitable for complex web applications that require SEO optimization and fast initial loading.</li>
            <li>Server Load: SSR can increase server load compared to client-side rendering (CSR) because the server must render pages for each request.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>SSR strikes a balance between SEO optimization and client-side interactivity, making it valuable for certain types of web applications.</p>
